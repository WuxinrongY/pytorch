6 数据载入
Args:
        dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
        batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
            (default: ``1``).
        shuffle (bool, optional): 是否随机打乱顺序
        sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): 抽样器，可以在torch.utils.data.sampler中进行自定义
        batch_sampler (Sampler or Iterable, optional): like :attr:`sampler`, but
            returns a batch of indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with
            :attr:`batch_size`, :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`,
            and :attr:`drop_last`.
        num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
            loading. ``0`` means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
            (default: ``0``)
        collate_fn (callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a
            mini-batch of Tensor(s).  Used when using batched loading from a
            map-style dataset.
        pin_memory (bool, optional):数据会被存在到与GPU相连的CPU内存中
        drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch,
            if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
            the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last batch
            will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
        timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for collecting a batch
            from workers. Should always be non-negative. (default: ``0``)
        worker_init_fn (callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called on each
            worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as
            input, after seeding and before data loading. (default: ``None``)
        generator (torch.Generator, optional): If not ``None``, this RNG will be used
            by RandomSampler to generate random indexes and multiprocessing to generate
            `base_seed` for workers. (default: ``None``)
        prefetch_factor (int, optional, keyword-only arg): Number of samples loaded
            in advance by each worker. ``2`` means there will be a total of
            2 * num_workers samples prefetched across all workers. (default: ``2``)
        persistent_workers (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will not shutdown
            the worker processes after a dataset has been consumed once. This allows to
            maintain the workers `Dataset` instances alive. (default: ``False``)
